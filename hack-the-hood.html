		<strong>Partners: </strong>
		Oakland Local; United Roots Oakland
                <br />
		<strong>Audience:</strong>
		Small Business Owners; Youth, Ages 16-24
		<br />
		<strong>Goals:</strong> 
		1) Increase visibility of small businesses in Oakland;
		2) expose youth to career opportunities in the Tech Industry.
	</div>
</div>
<div class="cases-facts">
	<strong>Problem:</strong> 
        1) Many local small businesses have limited visibility online and through social media channels.
		2) Local economy suffers from inability to effectively connect with influx of new residents and consumers.
		3) Lack of programs providing local youth with relevant experience and pathways into careers in the tech industry.
</div>
<div class="cases-facts">
	<strong>Insight:</strong>
        1) Influx of new residents and consumers are wired. Local businesses can increase visibility by building websites and improving social media presence.
		2) Several technology industry leaders are headquartered in the SF Bay Area. We can leverage training programs to provide hands on technical experience and create pathways for Â youth embracing the technology industry as a viable and desirable career path.
</div>
<div class="cases-facts">
	<strong>Solution:</strong>
	Provide technical training in high in-demand multimedia and tech skills to youth who will then apply their learning through real-world consulting projects with locally-owned businesses. Youth gain hands-on training building mobile friendly, responsive websites; executing search engine optimization campaigns; and getting clients listed on local maps and in local directories. Youth also gather transferable technical and adaptive skills, such as service leadership, entrepreneurship, team communication and project management.
